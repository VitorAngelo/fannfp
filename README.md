This library was based on the Fast Artificial Neural Network Library.
Please visit http://leenissen.dk/fann/ for the original software, which
is copyrighted 2003-2016 by Steffen Nissen (steffen.fann@gmail.com).

This is a subset of the original code, which kept most of its strucure,
but was changed to allow tests with different numeric representations and
numerical approximations. Some features have also been added.

It currently builds cleanly on Debian based Linux distributions and is
tested on Intel PCs and ARM boards.
