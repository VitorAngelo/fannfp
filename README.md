# fannfp

This library was based on the Fast Artificial Neural Network Library,
(please visit http://leenissen.dk/fann/ for the original software). It is a
subset of the original code, which kept most of its strucure, but was 
changed to allow tests with different numeric representations and
numerical approximations.

It currently builds cleanly on Debian based Linux distributions and is
tested on Intel PCs and ARM boards.
